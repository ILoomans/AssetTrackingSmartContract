# MintOrigin Smart Contract

A smart contract to track and trace the origin of an asset while protecting the anonymity of the owners. The basic idea is that a NFT is sent as the asset is sold along, guaranteeing an immutable history of the assets past that cannot be tampered with. It allows the manufacturer of the asset to list distributors who then can perform check ups on the asset. This platform allows for the removal of information assymetry in the resale process, by making it easy to identify both counterfeits and stolen assets. The contract is based off of an ERC721 contract as all assets are Non-Fungible (unique). You can interact with this contract on (https://www.mintorigin.io/) and even download a mobile wallet (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.modemo&hl=en_US&gl=US).
